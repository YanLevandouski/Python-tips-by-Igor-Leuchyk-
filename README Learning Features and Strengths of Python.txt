Exercise 1:

Install Numpy, Pandas, Maths packages.
Generate a sequence of 100 random numbers (not integer, in the range from 1 to 100) for 100 times.
Calculate the sum / mean for the list as 2 separate lists and dispaly them both.

Conclusion: "random" parctically doesn't generate critical valurs (close to 0 or 100).
And after generating the same lists for 100 times we can see that its values go around +/- the same (for avarages +/- 50, for sum +/- 50 as well but multiplied by 100).
This indicates a normal distribution of random values which is typical for the "random" module.
