Exercise #1:

To create class called "Vehicle" (to determine the type of the vehicle).

Every class should contain:
 - vehicle type (string);
 - max speed (float);
 - mileage (int).

In this class we have to present the method of description. The method should provide us with whole vehicle description.

Exercise #2:

To create 2 child classes:
 - bus: it should inherit all parent class's valies as well as have its own - "passenger capacity" (by default == 50);
 - automobile: it should inherit all parent class's valies as well as have its own - "vehicle color" (by default == white).

Also, we need to create a method in parent's class called "rent".
This method by default should count squared number of seats for each child class.

Exercise #3:

To create a "Service_alert" method which would trigger a message "Service Required!" as many times as how many times mileage is greater than 10000.
For example: mileage < 10000 => "No Service Required!"; mileage = 10000 => "Service Required!"; mileage = 40000 => "Service Required! Service Required! Service Required! Service Required!"; mileage = 10240 => "Service Required!"
